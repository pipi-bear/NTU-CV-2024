This repository contains homework when I was taking the course "Computer Vision" in NTU CSIE (2024 Fall) conducted by prof. 傅楸善

I uploaded them because I was not from a CS-related department for my undergrad, thus encountered many difficulties, and hope to help sutdents like me :)   

However, since I'm not familiar with coding, the code might be lengthy, not that elegant, and includes lots of comments explaining the basics.
But if this is what you need, feel free to take anything!  
 Just be cautious to the errors in my homework, which are stated as below.

# Important: Grades and errors in my code

For most of the homework files except __HW1__ and __HW8__, they're completely correct and received full grades.
The errors are:

- HW1: Rotation in part (d) (-15)
> I asked the TA when I got the grade, but I'm not quite sure because it's been a while since I finally decided to edit this readme file XD
- HW8: Gaussian noise, amp = 30 opening-closing, closing-opening (-15)

Anyways, you can freely use the correct parts to help you finish your own 

# Directory organization

## Turned in homework and details

In each directory named as `HW_`, you can find some scattered files and a subdirectory named as "my student ID + HW_", along with a .zip file of this subdirectory.

The .zip file (or the subdirectory itself) contains what I turned in, which includes:

1. the report (with brief explanations about the code structure)
2. a .py or .ipynb file that is the source code of this HW

Using the code in this subdirectory will ensure you to get the same results (grades) as I mentioned above.  
In some of the HW, you can find both a .py file and a .ipynb file, if you need really detailed explanations,
including things like the intuition behind, or the mathematical details, they might be included in the .ipynb one since I prefer writing them in the markdown cells.

Therefore, if you find anything confusing, just check for the .ipynb file or the report (or submit an issue would totally be fine!)

## Resulting images

I think most of the time, I just let the resulting pictures scatter in the directory, if you need to make sure that your result is the same as mine,
you can look for these files, or check them in the report.

## Additional info

In some HW, I read the corresponding part in the textbook, write notes, and export the pages that are needed into a pdf file into the HW directory.  

For example, in HW6, you can find a pdf file named `HW6_yokoi_connectivity_number.pdf`, this might be useful if you don't want to read the whole
chapter and find the needed contents.
